Lizard Abundance Prediction Using Random Forest
Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict the abundance of lizards based on environmental, physiological, and chemical features. The dataset used for this analysis is derived from ecological studies and contains features such as species abundance, temperature, elevation, and chemical compounds. The model chosen for this analysis is Random Forest due to its effectiveness in handling complex relationships and providing feature importance insights.

Key Objectives
Predict the abundance of lizards using machine learning.

Understand the impact of various ecological and chemical factors on lizard populations.

Provide a basis for eco-evolutionary insights through data-driven methods.

Data
The dataset used in this project is from Dryad: 10.5061/dryad.83bk3j9nr and contains 58 rows and several features, including environmental variables (temperature, elevation, etc.), species data, and chemical compounds.

Features included:

Environmental factors: Bio1 (annual mean temperature), Bio4 (temperature seasonality), Bio6 (precipitation), etc.

Species data: Lizard species (e.g., Sceloporus species).

Chemical compounds: Various acids and alcohols (e.g., Octadecanoic acid, 9-Hexadecenoic acid).

Ecological data: Richness, abundance, sample mass, and more.

Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and explored the structure.

Cleaned missing or irrelevant data.

Selected key features related to species abundance.

Modeling:

Used a Random Forest Regressor to predict lizard abundance based on the selected features.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Evaluated the model using R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics.

Feature Importance:

Analyzed which features (e.g., temperature, sample mass) were the most important in predicting lizard abundance.

Results
The Random Forest model showed a promising performance in predicting lizard abundance, with a strong R² score (include the actual score here).

Key features influencing abundance included Bio1 (annual mean temperature), Bio6 (precipitation), and Sample_mass.

Visualizations like feature importance plots and prediction vs actual value scatter plots are included to illustrate the model's performance.
