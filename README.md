**Lizard Abundance Prediction Using Random Forest**

**Overview**

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the abundance of Sceloporus lizards using environmental, physiological, and chemical features. By training a Random Forest Regressor, we aim to uncover the most impactful variables influencing lizard populations, while leveraging interpretability techniques such as SHAP and correlation analysis. The insights contribute to eco-evolutionary studies by shedding light on species-specific responses to environmental and biochemical conditions.

**Key Objectives**

Predict the abundance of lizards using machine learning.

Understand the influence of environmental and physiological factors on abundance.

Perform species-specific modeling and visual exploration.

Provide interpretable insights using SHAP and feature importance.

**Data**

The dataset used in this project is from Dryad: https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.83bk3j9nr and contains 58 rows and several features, including environmental variables (temperature, elevation, etc.), species data, and chemical compounds.

**Main Feature Categories:**
