**Lizard Abundance Prediction Using Random Forest**

**Overview**
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict the abundance of lizards based on environmental, physiological, and chemical features. The dataset used for this analysis is derived from ecological studies and contains features such as species abundance, temperature, elevation, and chemical compounds. The model chosen for this analysis is Random Forest due to its effectiveness in handling complex relationships and providing feature importance insights.

**Data**
The dataset used in this project is from Dryad: 10.5061/dryad.83bk3j9nr and contains 58 rows and several features, including environmental variables (temperature, elevation, etc.), species data, and chemical compounds.

**Features included:**

Environmental factors: Bio1 (annual mean temperature), Bio4 (temperature seasonality), Bio6 (precipitation), etc.

Species data: Lizard species (e.g., Sceloporus species).

Chemical compounds: Various acids and alcohols (e.g., Octadecanoic acid, 9-Hexadecenoic acid).

Ecological data: Richness, abundance, sample mass, and more.
